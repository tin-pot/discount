>A common stumbling block when porting C source software are
 functions that are missing on the target platform, albeit often
 common and standardized like C99's `round()` function or POSIX's
 `strcasecmp()`. By the technique presented here, these "little"
 functions can be added to the compilation for porting, without
 the need to change either the source code or the installed
 compiler and environment.

 
Motivation  
----------

Frequently, open source software uses functions and macros which
are more or less common and standardized, but are not available
in the target compilation environment --- a notorious case is
Microsoft Visual C/C++ on Windows (MSVC) with its lack of support
for POSIX and C99 features and library functions. The usual
workaround is to use the preprocessor for contraptions like this:

~~~
#include <stdarg.h>            /* MSVC: Lacking 'va_copy' of C99. */
#ifdef _MSC_VER
#define va_copy(a,b) ((a)=(b)) /* Workaround in MSVC. */
#endif

#ifdef _MSC_VER
#include <string.h>
#define strcasecmp _stricmp    /* Does the job in MSVC. */
#else
#include <strings.h>           /* MSVC: Not available (is POSIX). */
#endif

#ifdef _MSC_VER
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES      /* Make 'M_PI' visible in MSVC. */
#endif

#include <math.h>              /* MSVC: Lacking C99 extensions. */

#ifdef _MSC_VER
#define isnan _isnan           /* Does the job in MSVC. */
#endif

{
  /* ... */
  va_copy(a, b);      /* Maps to assignment hack in MSVC. */
  strcasecmp(s, t);   /* Maps to _stricmp() in MSVC. */
  phi = M_PI;         /* Available in MSVC because 
                       * _USE_MATH_DEFINES was defined before 
                       * inclusion of <math.h> */
  if (isnan(phi)) {   /* Maps to _isnan() in MSVC. */
    /*...*/
  }
}
~~~


Goals  
-----

Repeating this kind of ad hoc modifications is tedious, error
prone and introduces gratitious forks of the original source
code. A better solution would be to adapt the compilation process
in a manner that

1. allows to use the original source code without modification,
   and

2. also avoids changes to the installed compiler, its headers and
   libraries.

Despite the fact that this work originated from grappling with
MSVC, the following solution is not specific to this environment.


Implementation  
--------------

The first goal requires that the headers actually included are
not the pristine headers of the installed compiler. By the second
goal, the workaround hacks are not to be inserted in those
installed headers either, but we must direct the preprocessor to
find the "adapted" header files elsewhere --- before it finds the
compiler's own headers[^1].

Let's say we put our modified headers in a special directory
named[^2] `posc`, containing all the modifications, emulations
and adaptations we need:

    posc/stdio.h  
    posc/strings.h

We then put this directory in front of the include search path
(Windows command shell notation):

    set INCLUDE=.\posc;%INCLUDE%

Now the modified headers will be found during a compilation, as
a kind of "facade" in front of the real system headers. We want
these faux "facade" headers not to be complete extended copies of
the real ones, but only to contain the needed adaptations; they
thus need in turn to include the real standard headers.

However, we can not reference the real headers of the compiler
from our "facade" headers in the usual way:

    #include <stdio.h>

This would again find the adapted "faux" header, leading to an
infinite recursion and in the case of MSVC to the

    fatal error C1014: too many include files : depth = 1024

A remedy is to specify the standard headers with their full
pathname. For MSVC, we can use the `VCINSTALLDIR` environment
variable and make the path to the compiler's standard headers
available as a preprocessor macro:

~~~
C:\posc> REM Generate macro definition header:
C:\posc> ECHO "#define POSC_STDDIR %VCINSTALLDIR%\include\" >posc_hdrdir.h  
C:\posc> MORE posc_hdrdir.h
#define POSC_STDDIR C:\Program Files\MSVC2003\include\
~~~

But this fails if all standard headers are not in one and the
same directory, or they are to be found in the "Platform SDK"
etc. A solution that is both more convenient and also more
flexible and robust is to employ the preprocessor itself to
find the locations of all the needed standard headers and use
this to compile a list of macro definitions pointing to them.
A simple tool written in Standard C (see "Usage" below) can do
this. This gives us a generated header file like the following
`posc/posc_hdrdir.h`:

~~~
#define POSC_STDDIR C:\Program Files\MSVC2003\VC7\INCLUDE
#define POSC_ASSERT_HDR "C:\Program Files\MSVC2003\VC7\INCLUDE\assert.h"
#define POSC_CTYPE_HDR "C:\Program Files\MSVC2003\VC7\INCLUDE\ctype.h"
/* ... more definitions ... */
#define POSC_TIME_HDR "C:\Program Files\MSVC2003\VC7\INCLUDE\time.h"
~~~

Together with a fixed main include file `pisc/posc.h` with the
following content[^5] ...

~~~
#ifndef POSC_H_INCLUDED
#define POSC_H_INCLUDED

#include "posc_hdrdir.h"

#define POSC_XSTR(s) #s
#define POSC_STR(s) POSC_XSTR(s)
#ifdef _WIN32
# define POSC_XCONC(s1, s2) POSC_STR(s1 ## \\ ## s2)
#else
# define POSC_XCONC(s1, s2) POSC_STR(s1 ## / ## s2)
#endif
#define POSC_CONC(s1,s2) POSC_XCONC(s1,s2)

#define POSC_HEADER(h) POSC_CONC(POSC_STDDIR, h)

/* ... */

#endif /* POSC_H_INCLUDED */
~~~

... we are ready to compose our "faux" header files: they rely
on the defined location macros[^3] to include the system's header
files and add whatever workarounds are needed.


Examples  
--------

As an example, we make the `va_copy` workaround macro from
the introductory example available to any source program that
includes `<stdarg.h>` --- by creating our own `posc/stdarg.h`
containing this:

~~~
#ifndef POSC_STDARG_H_INCLUDED
#define POSC_STDARG_H_INCLUDED

#include "posc.h"
#include POSC_STDARG_HDR    /* The compiler's real <stdarg.h>. */

#ifndef va_copy             /* Safety net. */
# define va_copy(lhs, rhs) ((lhs) = (rhs))
#endif

#endif /* POSC_STDARG_H_INCLUDED */
~~~

The POSIX-defined string utilities are equally simple to provide
in a selfmade `posc/strings.h` header[^4]:

~~~
#ifndef POSC_STRINGS_H_INCLUDED
#define POSC_STRINGS_H_INCLUDED
#include "posc.h"

#ifdef _MSC_VER
/*
 * Include prototypes for _stricmp and _strnicmp, or we could
 * write out the prototypes here.
 */
# include POSC_STRING_HDR   /* The compiler's real <string.h>. */

# define strcasecmp  _stricmp 
# define strncasecmp _strnicmp 
#endif

#endif /* POSC_STRINGS_H_INCLUDED */
~~~

Further candidates for this technique (with respect to MSVC)
comprise:

`M_PI` etc.
:   (POSIX <math.h>): Available in MSVC when `_USE_MATH_DEFINES`
    is defined.

`isnan()` etc.
:   (C99 <float.h>): MSVC has some equivalents of these in the
    form `_isnan()` etc.

`round()` etc.
:   (C99 <math.h>): Must be implemented as a separate function.

`vsnprintf()` etc.
:   (C99 <stdio.h>): Can be built using MSVC's `_vsnprintf()` and
    `_vscprintf()` functions.

`getopt()` etc.
:   (POSIX <unistd.h>): Must be implemented as a separate
    function.


Usage  
-----

Though POSC is really rather a technique than a library, a
distribution package is available containing:

- A tool `findhdrdir.c` to find the locations of the 18
  Standard[^6] C headers and then generate the `posc_hdrdir.h`
  file accordingly.
- The `posc.h` main header file.
- Facade header files for various C99 and POSIX functions added
  to MSVC as well as `stdbool.h` etc.
- An implementation of `snprintf()` and `vsnprintf()` for MSVC.
- An implementation using the [free getopt][16] implementation
  (under a BSD-style licence) of the [`getopt()`][17] function.
- A `nmake` Makefile to bring all this to work.

Setting up for use is simple:

1. Unpack the archive into a directory eg. named `posc`.

2. Open a command shell with the environment set up for the
   compiler.

3. In the directory `posc`, run `nmake`. (This generates
   `posc_hdrdir.h` and the library `posc.lib`.)

To actually compile you source code with POSC,

- prepend the `posc` directory to the preprocessor include
  path and
- add the `posc` directory to the library search path.
   
For example, using the command line compiler `cl`, this can
be specified as:

~~~
cl /I.\posc source.c  /link /LIBPATH:.\posc 
~~~

The POSC headers add `posc.lib` as a default library if needed[^7]
so you don't need to indicate the library explicitly.

[^1]: Strictly speaking, we enter the realm of *undefined behaviour* here ...
[^2]: The name "POSC" was chosen because this string (1) seems to be not used by another library; (2) can be construed as an acronym of "**P**orting **o**f **S**tandard **C** Code", or "**P**orting **O**pen **S**ource **C** Code" or "**Po**rting **Sc**affold" or ...; (3) could suggest a vicinity to the *Portable Open Source Harness* `poshlib`.
[^3]: The ability to use macros in `#include` directives is a seldom-used feature in C --- and on this occasion a very useful one!
[^4]: As `strings.h` is an *addition* to the existing headers, our technique is not really needed in this case --- but the header certainly belongs into this same toolkit.
[^5]: You are not expected to understand this macro tinkering ;-)
[^6]: By "Standard C" we mean C90 here (ISO 9899-1990).
[^7]: Using the MSVC `#pragma comment( lib, "posc.lib" )`.

Markdown tool "discount" on Windows
===================================

This repository is a clone of [David Parsons' implementation][dp] in C
of [John Gruber's Markdown markup language][md], with added support to
build the package with Visual Studio on Windows.


Modifications
-------------

- Added pre-configured headers and sources, so that no `configure.sh`
  run is needed.

- Added project files for all executables and libraries.

- Added the [`freegetopt`][go] implementation of UNIX's `getopt()`
  function.


Building/Installing
-------------------

The package should build out of the box with Visual Studio 2003.NET
or newer (later versions of Visual Studio will import and convert the
project files).

The generated executable are statically linked: they only depend on
`kernel32.dll`. Place them wherever you like on your `PATH`.


About the Port
--------------

Porting to Windows was done with a fairly general technique, which
presents to the compiler a "faked" environment of header files on
top of the "real" header files of MSVC. All this is contained in the
`MSVC/posc` directory. See the `MSVC/posc/README.html` file there for
explanations.

All `discount` source files in the project root directory are
unmodified. Their need for functions like `strncasecmp()` (UNIX), or
`vsnprintf()` (C99), or `getopt()` gets satisfied completely out of
files in `posc`.

The included `getopt()` implementation is [freegetopt][go], its license
is in the file `LICENSE-freegetopt`.
